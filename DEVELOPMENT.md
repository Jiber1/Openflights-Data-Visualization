When meeting, we had our graph working and cleaned up our branches in the repository. We discussed options for BFS implementation. Resolved linker issues. Stubbed out BFS and Dijkstra's classes.

**Tues, Dec 7, 2021**
Merged Dijkstraâ€™s with BFS changes. We cleaned up our repo and wanted to make sure it worked on EWS. With a bunch of struggling, our code worked on EWS after having to mess with CMake. We reiterated the rest of the main focuses of the project.
