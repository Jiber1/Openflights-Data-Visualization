Communication
Team Meetings: Our team will meet once a week every Wednesday in person 6-9 PM
Assistance: Each member will rotate being a note-taker, starting with jberg30. Notes will be stored on a google document, time-stamped for each meeting. The note-taker is also responsible for drafting the weekly development log entry, which is approved by the team at the start of the following week’s meeting.
Respect:
Each team member can be contacted through email, Discord, or Slack. outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails within 48 hours.
The note-taker for the week will also serve as the ‘project lead’ for the weekly meeting. Their role is to ensure that every member of the group has had a chance to speak or state their opinion about a design decision or any other topic related to the final project. All decisions will be accepted by simple majority – while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.

Collaboration
Work distribution: We will assign workload that makes it fair for everyone. This means every person should get workloads that are similar in time commitment and difficulty. If for some reason, someone gets ill and isn’t able to work on the project, they will be expected to make up their work when able. STRENGTHS AND DESIRES. 
Time Commitment: 5 hours will be expected per week per person.
Conflict Resolution: All conflicts within the team will be decided by a majority vote, and majority rules, even in terms of public execution.
